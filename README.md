# gym-level

The [Level is a multiagent
domain featuring continuous state and action spaces. Currently,
several tasks are supported:

## Soccer

The soccer task initializes a single offensive agent on the field and rewards +1 for scoring a goal and 0 otherwise. In order to score a goal, the agent will need to know how to approach the ball and kick towards the goal. The sparse nature of the goal reward makes this task very difficult to accomplish.

# Installation

```bash
cd gym-soccer
pip install -e .
```
